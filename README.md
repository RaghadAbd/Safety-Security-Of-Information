# Safety-Security-Of-Information
lab 4 - 20221

you asked to Develop two applications: Each application should be placed in a folder and contain two pages, a static and a dynamic one.

Each of your applications must have a WEB-BUG that is placed in the second application. When the first application is invoked, it will locate the WEB-BUG from the second which should record the time of the request, the IP address the call is coming from, and the URL of the WEB-BUG.

In addition to the two folders, you have to attach a text file to show the relationship between the different pages and the reporting mechanism.

All of the above are to be placed in a folder named with your student ID, first name, and last name, compress it and submit. At the time of discussion, your apps should be published (free hosting is fine) and accessible.
